= JSON Schema

The *OAS Generator* provides an JSON Schema to simplify the writing of the configuration file.

The JSON schema is available at the following URL:

* https://chhorz.github.io/oas-generator/schema/oas-generator.schema.json

The following sections will show you how to enable the JSON schema support in some IDEs.

== IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open the Settings window and search for "JSON Schema Mappings".
2. Click the icon:plus[] icon to add a custom JSON Schema Mapping
3. Select *Version 7* and add the *URL* listed above.
4. Add mappings to the _File path pattern_, for example `oas-generator.yml`.
You can add as many path mappings as you like.

== VS Code

To use the JSON Schema within Visual Studio Code the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml[YAML (Red Hat)] extension must be installed.
Then the mapping of the schema URL to the file names must be added to the `settings.json`:

[source,json]
.settings.json
----
{
  "yaml.schemas": {
    "https://chhorz.github.io/oas-generator/schema/oas-generator.schema.json": ["oas-generator.yml"]
