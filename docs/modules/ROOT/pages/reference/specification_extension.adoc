= Specification Extensions

The OpenAPI specification allows using additional properties within a specification file.
These link:https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#specification-extensions[specification extensions] have to follow a specific naming convention.
They must begin with the following prefix: `x-`.

The *OAS Generator* adds the following properties to the `info` object:

[source,json]
----
{
  "info" : {
    "x-generated-by" : "oas-generator:0.3.0",
    "x-generated-ts" : "2020-04-21T08:16:42.509+02:00"
  }
}
----

These properties should act as hint, that the current file was generated automatically and ideally should not be changed manually.

The number of specification extensions was kept low intentionally.
The OpenAPI specification offers wide tooling support, and those extensions will not be supported by those tools.
